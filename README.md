# Employee Database - Employee Tracker

## Description

The **EmployeeTracker Database** application lets the user utilize a combination of tables found in the employee database to pull information in a more user friendly way. The employee tracker database, or ***employee_db***, houses important information on every employees, such as their name, role, employee id, department they work in and their salary. The application is split into multiple functions that make a call to the database to retreive the desired information. The functions let the user:
-   View all the employees,
-   View all the managers,
-   Add an employee,
-   Add a new department,
-   Create a Role,
-   Remove an employee,
-   Remove a department,
and exit the program.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project was to practice the use of ***MySql Workbench*** and ***Node.js***. Using NodeJs allowed for a connection between the two languages as well as a direct communication using the functions of ***query connection*** and ***inquirer*** to interact with the user.

**Employee Tracker** only runs on the console, meaning this program needs the user to interact with the server directly with no front end involved.
The code for this project was made with the intention of interacting with NodeJs syntax.
